# WheelCheck2SII
This is WheelCheck to ffb_lut.sii file converter. 

Usage: 

1.    Generate CSV file with WheelCheck(https://www.dropbox.com/s/3zxf5yd1bvujyi5/WheelCheck_1_72.zip?dl=0) by performing the linear force test. Depending on amount of points you set, the process will either end quickly or after 2 minutes. During the test DON'T TOUCH the wheel, otherwise you might affect the results, especially if the wheel is unable to generate tiny forces on its own.
2.    Launch WheelCheck2SII, then press "Load CSV file", then locate CSV file generated by WheelCheck.
After opening the file you'll get rough visualization of the response chart in the file.
3.    Press "Save ffb_lut.sii file". Select the location where you want to save, then press "Save". 
4.    Install the LUT file according to the info on this site: https://modding.scssoft.com/wiki/Documentation/Engine/Advanced_input_configuration/Force_feedback_LUT

If everything went correctly, after opening the game and opening the settings on "Controllers" sub-menu, you should see the ‚ùó next to the total gain slider. This means that the file was loaded correctly.
